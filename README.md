# Welcome to my blog...
### Or should I say, our blog...

This is an updated version of [The Hacker-Blog Theme](https://github.com/tocttou/hacker-blog) which itself is a modified version of [Hacker Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker), described *a minimalistic, responsive jekyll theme built for hackers.*
All I am doing is putting pieces together of other people's work, with a little customization of my own. And I know that. Anyone working in the opensource communtity knows that. So here is a list:

- [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) the very fast static site generator technology that's supported by Github-Pages by default. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. Jekyll is written in Ruby. It has 1000+ contributers, where you can view here: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/graphs/contributors

- plugins:
  - [jekyll-seo-tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) [Contributers](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/graphs/contributors)
  - [jekyll-paginate](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate) this project is not mantained anymore, but it still works fine. [Contributers](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate/graphs/contributors)
  - jekyll-sitemap
