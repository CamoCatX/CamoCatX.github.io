![](/assets/ninja1.png) Hello! My name is Nima, Welcome to my Website! ;)

I am a Penetration Tester and Bug Bounty Hunter with Software Development Background.

I have been using computers and programming from an early age since the prehistoric MS-DOS ages (GW/QBasic and Foxpro) then Visual Basic 6 in old Windows versions and then C#, Microsoft Visual Foxpro, PHP, Javascript, Python... in Windows and Linux.

<br>
### My Prior Software Experience
* * *

* Full-Time Legacy Code Maintenance, Bug Fixes, Enhancement and Development of New Features.

* VoIP Software Solutions and the whole VoIP stack (also Sales, Technical and Executive fields) including Software Development, Deployment, Network Infrastructure, Security, Support...

* Connecting Legacy Systems to Newer VoIP and Software Technologies.

* Finding solutions for difficult or impossible IT/Software problems. Such as finding new solutions (that had never done before anywhere) for bypassing some limitations of a closed-source proprietary legacy programming language and finding workarounds for some programming language bugs. I have solved _every_ important technical problem that was handed to me during my career. I believe:

> Nothing is impossible in IT and Security and the only limitation is in our own Imagination!

* Expanded open-source IP telephony system and developed softphones with SIP,RTP protocols and connected these systems and their services to legacy software.  

<br>
### My Work Now
* * *

I am a full-time Cybersecurity Researcher now and I love every moment of it!

My work now is mostly on Network Penetration Testing and also Web Application Security.

I love almost all Technical Cybersecurity fields but prefer Offensive Security and Red Teaming practices over Defensive Security and Blue Teaming but I'm curious overall and read everything related to Cybersecurity! :)

<br>
### Certifications and Knowledge
* * *

* Some certificate courses in Cybersecurity from a private company and some Programming language courses.

* Multiple VoIP Certifications (ECE: Elastix Certified Engineer, ESM: Elastix Security Master, Asterisk Programming(AMI,AGI, Dial Plans Scripting, PHP, .NET Core APIs...) (Passed with high score).
* I've studied Network+, CEH: Certified Ethical Hacker certifications and I'm preparing to get [PEN-200 OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) of Offensive Security. I like [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/) and [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/) companies.

* I take my Professional Education very seriously and usually try to pass Certification Exams with High Scores.

<br>
### Future Certifications
* * *

- After OSCP, I'm planning to get [PEN-300 OSEP(Evasion Techniques and Breaching Defenses)](https://www.offensive-security.com/pen300-osep/) and [WEB-300 OSWE(ADVANCED WEB ATTACKS AND EXPLOITATION)](https://www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe/).

- In the following years I'd also like to get [EXP-301 OSED(WINDOWS USER MODE EXPLOIT DEVELOPMENT)](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp301-osed/) then [EXP-401 OSEE(ADVANCED WINDOWS EXPLOITATION)](https://www.offensive-security.com/awe-osee/) certifications, I know OSEE has the hardest exam ever, probably it's the hardest IT/Security exam ever created, but I welcome challenges! :) and I'm also used to hard work in this field so if they are in the direction of my future Goals, I'll definitely get them because I also like Exploit Analysis and Development areas.

- I also like these SANS courses and certifications and I'm planning to take some of them in the future:

  - Web Application Security: [SEC642(Advanced Web App Penetration Testing, Ethical Hacking, and Exploitation Techniques)](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-web-app-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking/)

  - Network Penetration Testing: [SEC660: Advanced Penetration Testing, Exploit Writing, and Ethical Hacking (GXPN: GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester)](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-penetration-testing-exploits-ethical-hacking/)

  - Industrial Cybersecurity: [ICS410: ICS/SCADA Security Essentials (GICSP: Global Industrial Cyber Security Professional)](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/ics-scada-cyber-security-essentials/), [ICS612: ICS Cybersecurity In-Depth](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/ics-cyber-security-in-depth/)

  - Misc.: [SEC587: Advanced Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering and Analysis](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-open-source-intelligence-gathering-analysis/)

  - I also like to further my academic education in Cybersecurity field in the future if the knowledge gained there is really practical and useful.
