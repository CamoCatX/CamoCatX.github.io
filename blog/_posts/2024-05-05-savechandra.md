Chandra is a website that is advocating for the U.S. Congress to not cut funding to NASAâ€™s Chandra X-ray Observatory. You can visit it itself, so I will keep this short and sweet:

* ~400 publications per year
* Ground breaking work on the study of blackholes
* [It costs $293M](https://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/faq/chandra/chandra-8.html) for 4 years of operation, about the same price of 3 military fighter jets, meaning on average that the telescope costs less/year then a fighter jet
