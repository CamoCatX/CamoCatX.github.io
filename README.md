## Technology Introduction

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a very fast static site generator technology that's supported by Github-Pages by default. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. Jekyll is written in Ruby.

### Gems
Gems are code you can include in Ruby projects. Gems package specific functionality. You can share gems across multiple projects or with other people. Gems can perform actions like:

* Converting a Ruby object to JSON
* Pagination
* Interacting with APIs such as GitHub

Jekyll is a gem. Many Jekyll plugins are also gems, including jekyll-feed, jekyll-seo-tag and jekyll-archives.

### Gemfile
A Gemfile is a list of gems used by your site. Every Jekyll site has a Gemfile in the main folder.
