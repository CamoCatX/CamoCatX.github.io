![](/assets/ninja1.png)Hello! My name is Nima, Welcome to my Website.

I am a Network Penetration Tester, Bug Hunter and an ex-Software Developer.

I have been using computers and been programming from an early age since the prehistoric MS-DOS ages (GW/QBasic and FoxPro) then Visual Basic 6 in old Windows versions and then C#, Microsoft Visual FoxPro, PHP, JavaScript, Python... in Windows and Linux.

<br>
### My Prior Roles and Works in the Software Field
* * *

* Full Stack Software Developer working in all layers of Software Development, also Sales, Support and Deployment.

* Full-Time Legacy Code Maintenance, Bug Fixes, Enhancement and Development of New Features.

* Full Stack VoIP Engineer: VoIP Software Solutions and the whole VoIP stack including Software Development, Deployment, Network Infrastructure, Security, Support...

* Connecting Legacy Systems to Newer VoIP and Software Technologies.

* Finding solutions for difficult or impossible IT/Software problems. Such as finding novel solutions for bypassing some limitations of a closed-source proprietary legacy programming language and finding workarounds for some programming language bugs. I have solved _every_ important technical problem that was handed to me during my career. Some of them were difficult and challenging enough that they were left unsolved for years, I believe:

> Nothing is impossible in IT and Security and the only limitation is in our own Imagination!

* Expanded open-source IP telephony system and developed softphones with SIP,RTP protocols and connected these systems and their services to legacy software.  

<br>
### My Work Now
* * *

I am a full-time Cybersecurity Researcher now and I love every moment of it.

My work now is mostly on Network Penetration Testing and also Web Application Security.

I love almost all Technical Cybersecurity fields but prefer Offensive Security and Red Teaming practices over Defensive Security and Blue Teaming but I'm curious overall and read everything related to Cybersecurity! :)

<br>
### Notable Achievements and Knowledge
* * *

* Solved most of the <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path" class="no-decoration"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Web Security Academy</code></a> Labs and really appreciate the great effort they've been putting to prepare this world-class material. My current rank is below 300. <a href="https://portswigger.net" class="no-decoration"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Portswigger</code></a>'s Research is the best in Web Security and their Web Security Academy and Burp Suite are highly recommended.

* In the Top 1% of <a href="https://tryhackme.com" class="no-decoration"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TryHackMe</code></a>. This is another great world-class resource that I highly recommend. It is extremely addictive perhaps even more than video games! and you'll also learn a ton and grow as a Cybersecurity expert, both blue and redteam contents are fantastic.

* Multiple <a href="https://tryhackme.com" class="no-decoration"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TryHackMe</code></a> certificates for both Red and Blue team pathways, also I'm working to get all of their certificates (currently there are around 14 of them).

* Currently learning German as my fourth language! Putting a few minutes aside every day to learn this language. I think I'll continue my daily learning routine for at least 5-6 more years to gain mastery or at least C1/2 level fluency then I'll start my next language, it may probably be Chinese, because I only have time for learning the most important scientific/international languages & I also enjoy learning new languages.

* Some other certificate courses in Cybersecurity and some Programming language courses.

* Multiple VoIP Certifications ( ECE: Elastix Certified Engineer, ESM: Elastix Security Master, Asterisk Programming(AMI,AGI, Dial Plans Scripting, PHP, .NET Core APIs...) ).

* Network+, CEH: Certified Ethical Hacker.

* Some Physical Training Certifications: Nutrition, Human Anatomy, Bodybuilding, also years of experience in physical training and Bodybuilding.

* As a hobby, I also like to study different science fields in order to get a better view of what `Life` is.

<br>
### Future Certifications (that I'm interested in)
* * *

- I'd love to get [PEN-200 OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/) of OffSec as soon as I can. I'm familiar with most of its contents and have experience in them but need to do more hands-on labs to prepare myself for the exam.

- After OSCP, I'm planning to get [PEN-300 OSEP(Evasion Techniques and Breaching Defenses)](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-300/) and [WEB-300 OSWE(ADVANCED WEB ATTACKS AND EXPLOITATION)](https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-300/).

- Exploit Analysis and Development is not in my priority list now but I might pursue this path in the future: [EXP-301 OSED(WINDOWS USER MODE EXPLOIT DEVELOPMENT)](https://www.offsec.com/courses/exp-301/) then [EXP-401 OSEE(ADVANCED WINDOWS EXPLOITATION)](https://www.offsec.com/courses/exp-401/) certifications (OSEE has one of the hardest exams ever, probably it's the hardest IT/Security exam ever created but it is really worth the effort for those who are following this path).

- I also like these SANS courses and certifications and I'm planning to take some of them in the future:

  - Web Application Security: [SEC642(Advanced Web App Penetration Testing, Ethical Hacking, and Exploitation Techniques)](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-web-app-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking/)

  - Network Penetration Testing: [SEC660: Advanced Penetration Testing, Exploit Writing, and Ethical Hacking (GXPN: GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester)](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-penetration-testing-exploits-ethical-hacking/)

  - Industrial Cybersecurity: [ICS410: ICS/SCADA Security Essentials (GICSP: Global Industrial Cyber Security Professional)](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/ics-scada-cyber-security-essentials/), [ICS612: ICS Cybersecurity In-Depth](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/ics-cyber-security-in-depth/)

  - Web3 Security: Blockchain and Smart Contracts: [SEC554: Blockchain and Smart Contract Security](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/blockchain-smart-contract-security)

  - Misc.: [SEC587: Advanced Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering and Analysis](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-open-source-intelligence-gathering-analysis/)

  - I also like to further my academic education in Cybersecurity field in the future if the knowledge gained there is not just theoretical but also up to date and practical in the industry.

I have great curiosity and enthusiasm for Cybersecurity and I plan to learn more and expand my knowledge and experience every day in this beautiful field.
