![](/assets/ninjutsu1.png)[^1] Hello! My name is Nima, Welcome to my Website.

I am a Network Penetration Tester and Bug Hunter and an ex-Software Developer.

I have been using computers and been programming from an early age since the prehistoric MS-DOS ages (GW/QBasic and FoxPro) then Visual Basic 6 in old Windows versions and then C#, Microsoft Visual FoxPro, PHP, JavaScript, Python... in Windows and Linux.

<br>
### My Prior Work Experience in the Software field and my Technical Mindset
* * *

* Full Stack Software Developer working in all layers of Software Development, also Sales, Support and Deployment.

* Full-Time Legacy Code Maintenance, Bug Fixes, Enhancement and Development of New Features.

* Full Stack VoIP Engineer: VoIP Software Solutions and the whole VoIP stack (Technical also Sales and Executive fields) including Software Development, Deployment, Network Infrastructure, Security, Support...

* Connecting Legacy Systems to Newer VoIP and Software Technologies.

* Finding solutions for difficult or impossible IT/Software problems. Such as finding new solutions (that had never done before anywhere) for bypassing some limitations of a closed-source proprietary legacy programming language and finding workarounds for some programming language bugs. I have solved _every_ important technical problem that was handed to me during my career. I believe:

> Nothing is impossible in IT and Security and the only limitation is in our own Imagination!

* Expanded open-source IP telephony system and developed softphones with SIP,RTP protocols and connected these systems and their services to legacy software.  

<br>
### My Work Now
* * *

I am a full-time Cybersecurity Researcher now and I love every moment of it.

My work now is mostly on Network Penetration Testing and also Web Application Security.

I love almost all Technical Cybersecurity fields but prefer Offensive Security and Red Teaming practices over Defensive Security and Blue Teaming but I'm curious overall and read everything related to Cybersecurity! :)

<br>
### Certifications and Knowledge
* * *

* Solved most of the <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path" class="no-decoration"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Web Security Academy</code></a> Labs and really appreciate the great effort they've put to prepare this world-class material.

* Some certificate courses in Cybersecurity and some Programming language courses.

* Multiple VoIP Certifications (ECE: Elastix Certified Engineer, ESM: Elastix Security Master, Asterisk Programming(AMI,AGI, Dial Plans Scripting, PHP, .NET Core APIs...).

* Network+, CEH: Certified Ethical Hacker.

* Some Physical Training Certifications: Nutrition, Human Anatomy, Bodybuilding, also years of experience in physical training and Bodybuilding.

* As a hobby, I also like to study different science fields in order to get a better view of what `Life` is.

<br>
### Future Certifications (that I'm interested in)
* * *

- I'd love to get [PEN-200 OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) of Offensive Security as soon as I can. I'm familiar with most of its contents and have experience in them but need to do more hands-on labs to prepare myself for the exam.

- After OSCP, I'm planning to get [PEN-300 OSEP(Evasion Techniques and Breaching Defenses)](https://www.offensive-security.com/pen300-osep/) and [WEB-300 OSWE(ADVANCED WEB ATTACKS AND EXPLOITATION)](https://www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe/).

- Exploit Analysis and Development is not in my priority list now but I might pursue this path in the future: [EXP-301 OSED(WINDOWS USER MODE EXPLOIT DEVELOPMENT)](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp301-osed/) then [EXP-401 OSEE(ADVANCED WINDOWS EXPLOITATION)](https://www.offensive-security.com/awe-osee/) certifications (OSEE has one of the hardest exams ever, probably it's the hardest IT/Security exam ever created but it is really worth the effort for those who are following this path).

- I also like these SANS courses and certifications and I'm planning to take some of them in the future:

  - Web Application Security: [SEC642(Advanced Web App Penetration Testing, Ethical Hacking, and Exploitation Techniques)](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-web-app-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking/)

  - Network Penetration Testing: [SEC660: Advanced Penetration Testing, Exploit Writing, and Ethical Hacking (GXPN: GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester)](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-penetration-testing-exploits-ethical-hacking/)

  - Industrial Cybersecurity: [ICS410: ICS/SCADA Security Essentials (GICSP: Global Industrial Cyber Security Professional)](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/ics-scada-cyber-security-essentials/), [ICS612: ICS Cybersecurity In-Depth](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/ics-cyber-security-in-depth/)

  - Web3 Security: Blockchain and Smart Contracts: [SEC554: Blockchain and Smart Contract Security](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/blockchain-smart-contract-security)

  - Misc.: [SEC587: Advanced Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering and Analysis](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-open-source-intelligence-gathering-analysis/)

  - I also like to further my academic education in Cybersecurity field in the future if the knowledge gained there is not just theoretical but also up to date and practical in the industry.
