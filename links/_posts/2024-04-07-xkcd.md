When I want to read some nerdy humor, I don't have to go far. A small group of people maintain this, and it often features little stick figures saying witty things. It covers many areas of interest, like
physics, math, language quarks, and just overall nerdy humor. On April Fools day every year, they tend to make something interactive. Anyways, xkcd often fills niche interests that many people have, even though
they may not have the same hobbies or jobs.
